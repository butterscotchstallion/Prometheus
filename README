Prometheus is a PHP based database upgrader born from the misery and strife of doing it manually

One of my very first long-running projects involved periodically updating the database and code,
and as you might imagine, doing it manually eventually became quite a burden.

Thus, Prometheus was born. After I automated this task, it was like fire was given to my team and
we basked in the glory of automated upgrades.
